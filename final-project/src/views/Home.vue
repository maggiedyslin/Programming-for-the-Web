        <h1>Welcome</h1>

        <p><em>Deep Blue</em> - seen above - is one of the largest female sharks ever recorded, and was first spotted in Mexico in 2014 by a Mauricio Hoyos Padilla. She has been featured a few times on Discovery Channel's Shark Week. She is massive, weighing in at about 20 tons. She is the inspiration behind <em>Deep Blue</em>, where eventually, t-shirts and various other items will be created to help support organizations that bring awareness to shark finning. The goal of this company is to bring to light how inhumane shark finning is, and how dangerous it is to the ocean's shark populations - we need the sharks, much like we need the bees.</p>

        <h2>What is shark finning?</h2>

        <p>Shark finning is the inhumane process of cutting off all of a shark's fins; they're eventually tossed back into the ocean, where they're left to die. They either suffocate due to not being able to swim, passing water through their gills; die of blood loss; or are eaten by another predator. This devastating practice is used for dishes such as <em>Shark Fin Soup</em>.</p>

        <h2>What is shark fin soup?</h2>

        <p>Shark fin soup originated during the Song dynasty in China. The imperial family and court members were served a dish of shark fins - which can include a variety of shark species. The dish was meant to showcase power, wealth, and generosity. The raw fins are processed by removing the skin and denticles, and then trimming them into shapes and bleaching them to a more desirable coloration. The fins are then used in a soup, <em>Shark Fin Soup</em>, which is created with a broth. The fins have no flavor - that comes from the broth.</p>

        <h2>So, what's the big deal?</h2>

        <p>Sharks play an important role to the ecosystem. They are considered an apex predator, and maintain the species below them in the food chain. They are an indicator for ocean health by removing the weak and sick, while also keeping the balance with competitors to ensure various specie diversity. They indirectly maintain seagrass and coral reef habitats by shifting their prey's spatial habitat, which alters feeding strategy and diets of other species.</p>

        <p>Essentially, if sharks are completely eliminated, it will have a ripple effect: for example, the larger predatory fish (groupers) increase in abundance and feed off of the herbivores. With less herbivores, macroalgae expands and coral can no longer compete, which shifts the ecosystem to one of algae dominance. This affects the survival of the reef system.</p>
