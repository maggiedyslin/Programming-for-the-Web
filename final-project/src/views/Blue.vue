        <p><em>Deep Blue</em> is a massive Great White Shark. As shown, she is probably one of the largest Great White Sharks ever spotted in the ocean. She is said to be over fifty years old; as she continues to age, she will continue to grow, though at a slower rate. Most Great White Shark species have an estimated life expectancy of around 70 years of age. She was first spotted in Mexico; she is known to be calm and non-aggressive around humans as well as dolphins.</p>

        <p>She was first seen in 2014 as part of Discovery's Shark Week, off the coast of Guadalupe Island, Mexico. She is identified by the pigmentation and markings on her body; she has a large laceration over the right side of her body, and the unique pigmentation, markings and the unique pattern on her underside, where the white meets the gray is a good way of identifying her. Another way to identify sharks is by their dorsal fins; each one is unique and different.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, Deep Blue has not been tagged, though she is often spotted in Hawaii and Guadalupe Island during certain parts of the year.</p>
