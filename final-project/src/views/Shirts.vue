        <h1>Business</h1>

        <p>I am hoping to build a brand - <em>Deep Blue</em> - to educate people on the Shark Finning problem. Deep Blue, as stated, is one of the largest female Great Whites ever recorded. She's one of the most well-known and recognizable sharks out there, due to her massive size. I want the <em>Deep Blue</em> brand to be just as recognizable. There will be variations of different products with my company; donations will be made to many non-profit organizations trying to end the practice. Ideas I have are endless, and include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>T-Shirts *</li>
            <li>Flyers</li>
            <li>Educational brochures</li>
            <li>"Shark cards" that explain different species of sharks</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whale Sharks</li>
                    <li>Great White Sharks</li>
                    <li>Hammerhead Sharks</li>
                    <li>Silky Sharks</li>
                    <li>Amount various other species threatened by shark finning</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>


        <p>T-Shirts have not been made yet, but the plan is to create various t-shirts with "Deep Blue" screen-printed on them; there will be a variety of different options, with different designs on either the front, back, or both sides of the t-shirt. Possibilities for apparel are endless.</p>

        <p>Another point of this business is to be as eco-friendly as possible. Plastics will be used as little as possible (or not at all, if it can be helped), and sustainable packaging will be used. Plastics are polluting the oceans, ending up in whale stomachs, wrapped around turtle necks or inside their noses - it's devastating to such a delicate ecosystem, and change is needed.</p>

        <p><em>* Various designs not shown.<br>
        ** This business is still currently in the works. T-Shirt designs are basic but will be expanded upon later on.</em></p>
