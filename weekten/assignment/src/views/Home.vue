            <p>
                Ever since I was little, I had been trying to beat my older brother in Mario - beat his high score,
                being able to stay alive longer than he could, getting further on levels - whatever the case, I 
                was always trying. Now, I play video games for fun (though still like to make efforts to beat my 
                older brother in games; Puyo Puyo Tetris is our go-to) between going to school and working.
